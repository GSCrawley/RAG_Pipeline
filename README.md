# RAG_Pipeline

## Q&A working w/document created locally, next steps: 
  ### keep it running in between queries so we don't have to run the server each time we want to ask a question 
  ### create memory to maintain context in the chat from one question to the next 
  ### work out out how to import external data to document_store

## i also plan to incorporate this pipeline into a web app with a simple UI
